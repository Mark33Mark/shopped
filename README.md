### 1. Description  

**What is this project?**  

*  Web developers frequently immerse themselves in a new technology to solve a problem, with only the online documentation for help find the information that matches the specific problem they’re trying to solve. This assignment requires reviewing the Redux online documentation and implementing the package by refactoring a functional codebase currently managing the state with the Context API.  
   
   [Live application:  shopp3d.herokuapp.com](https://shopp3d.herokuapp.com)  

**Why this project?**  

*  Whilst the Context API is gaining traction as an alternative to other state management libraries, such as Flux or MobX, the open source JavaScript library Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application.  As Redux is used a lot, this project is focused on reviewing the Redux documentation and then refactoring the code to move it from Context API to the Redux API.  


**What problem does this project solve?**  

*  It demonstrates the use of online documentation to implement a structural change in an existing code base that uses a different technology to either improve or solve a problem that the current code base can not do well.  

**Lessons learnt?**  

*  A functioning code base is never set and forgotten, adopting a principle of continuous improvement means testing the implementation of alternative or new technologies into your code base to assess if it is improving the functionality or performance of your code.
